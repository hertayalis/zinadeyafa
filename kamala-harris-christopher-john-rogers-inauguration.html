On the historic occasion of her becoming the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president in our nation's history, she chose a full look by the 2020 CFDA American Emerging Designer of the Year, Christopher John Rogers, accessorized with pearls by Puerto Rican-American designer Wilfredo Rosado, and a David Yurman flag pin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rogers, who is young, Black, and queer, is a rising star in American fashion. The 27-year-old, who founded his New York label in 2016, was raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and studied fashion at the Savannah College of Art and Design.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Responding to criticisms about his bold, colorful style, Rogers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2020/02/08/803037204/these-head-to-toe-fashions-were-inspired-by-grandmas-sunday-best data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told NPR" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">told NPR</a>, "I don't think that wearing hot pink and ruffles or bright yellow, or a really intense blue in shapes that take up space make you any less intelligent." He continued, "I don't think that the way that you dress should make you sacrifice your personality, or your point of view, or necessarily say anything about your intelligence."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rogers draws inspiration for his color-drenched designs from his upbringing in the Southern Baptist church where he developed a deep admiration of the attention to detail that went into monochromatically coordinated ensembles. Much of the grassroots organizing that won the election came out of such spaces.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The purple color itself—halfway between blue and red—is latent with significance, and matches the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a35257639/jill-biden-dress-inauguration-2021/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jonathan Cohen Unity coat" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Jonathan Cohen Unity coat</a> that First Lady Jill Biden wore yesterday arriving in Washington.</p><img alt="washington, dc january 19 l r douglas emhoff, us vice president elect kamala harris, dr jill biden and us president elect joe biden attend a memorial service to honor the nearly 400,000 american victims of the coronavirus pandemic at the lincoln memorial reflecting pool january 19, 2021 in washington, dc as the nations capital has become a fortress city of roadblocks, barricades and 20,000 national guard troops due to heightened security around bidens inauguration, 400 lights were placed around the reflecting pool to honor the nearly 400,000 americans killed by covid 19 photo by chip somodevillagetty images" title="COVID-19 Memorial Service Held In Washington On The Eve Of Biden&amp;apos;s Inauguration" width=5379 height=3586 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1297316261.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Chip Somodevilla/Getty</span><p>Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Vice President Kamala Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, and President Joe Biden attend the COVID-19 memorial service on January 19.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is also worth noting that the diversity with respect to age and race of the models in Rogers's runway shows aligns with the diversity in the cabinet and values the new White House espouses.
