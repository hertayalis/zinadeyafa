Sometimes it’s hard to say why we even watch dating reality shows anymore. People rarely end up in happy, long-term relationships, but for some reason, we still can’t take our eyes off the screen whenever a dating show pops up. After the success of the U.K.’s Love Island, which aired every night on ITV, the USA just had to make their own version."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, it’s time to take a look back at the OG Love Island stars who made Season 1 the hit that it was. Where are they now?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cashel Barnett</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=#>Cashel Barnett</a> didn't make it too far in Love Island Season 1, but luckily, it wouldn't be his only moment to shine. He went on to compete on <a href=#>The Challenge: USA</a> with his ex-girlfriend Kyra Green, although he also didn't make it too far. Now, he models for editorial shoots with Opt 1 Models, Stars Management, and The Driven Agency, and he plays drums with his band, Doom Cupcake.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dylan Curry and Alexandra Stewart</h2><p><a href=#>Dylan Curry</a> came, saw, and conquered Love Island Season 1, although he and his budding romance with Alexandra Stewart placed them in second in the finals. A few months after their time on the show, they shared on Instagram that things didn’t work out between them, but broke up on good terms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, Dylan plays lacrosse for the San Diego Lacrosse Club and works as a member of CrossFit TurnPoint, while Alexandra Stewart hosts the After the Island podcast.

They raced around the world, but their season was sadly cut short because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, they split up, so they didn't return to the race when filming picked back up. Ray has since appeared on <a href=#>Ex on the Beach</a> and Love Island Games. Caro is now a model, and she married entrepreneur Rene Lacad in 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kyra Green</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=#>Kyra Green</a> may not have made it to the Love Island USA finals, but she made it to our hearts. Her back-and-forth with Cashel and Jered left her on the outs. After her time on the show, Kyra appeared on The Challenge: USA, although she didn't make it to the finals. She's now a model and singer, spending time with family and making hilarious TikTok videos. She also appeared on MTV's Match Me If You Can in 2021 and Season 5 of Ex on the Beach.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zachary "Zac" Mirabelli and Elizabeth Weber</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#>Zac Mirabelli</a> and <a href=#>Elizabeth Weber</a> would go on to win the first season of Love Island USA, but their stories after the show aren't as lovey-dovey. They split shortly after filming, which they announced on their Instagram stories. Like his castmates, Zac models and spends time with family and friends. Elizabeth also models in addition to co-hosting After the Island with Alex. She's also been dating Hotstreak Fantasy Sports co-founder <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gianni Settino</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Weston Richey and Emily Salch</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p><a href=#>Emily Salch</a> and <a href=#>Weston Richey</a> were the last-placing couple in the Love Island Season 1 finals, but they actually stayed together the longest after the show. However, by Valentine's Day in 2020, Emily revealed that she changed herself too much to be what Weston wanted, so they split up on good terms. Both of them are now entrepreneurs — Emily co-founded Face-y, a health and beauty brand, while Weston makes creative content with his production company, XclusiV Productions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jered Youngblood</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jered Youngblood</a> came in hot as a new islander in Week 3, and he left just before the finals after coupling up with Kyra. Now, Jered spends his time in Kipahulu, Hawaii, where he is a banana harvester and tour guide. He also spends his free time spearfishing and modeling with ALEXA and Modern Muse agencies.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While there are plenty of other Love Island Season 1 cast members, they all got dumped or walked off days before the finals, and many of them are off doing their own things. Most of them are influencers and models since their time on the show, which makes a lot of sense! Cormac Murphy appeared on Season 10 of Celebs Go Dating, joining many of his co-stars as a tenured reality star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqqWZnpl6tLHArKanZWFixKmx0Z5kmqqVYsGpsdhmpaiv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
