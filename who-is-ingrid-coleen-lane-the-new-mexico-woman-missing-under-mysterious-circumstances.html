They said they offered to give Lane a ride back to town but she declined, telling them she was on her way to hike a nearby peak or elevation, but she didn’t specify which one. According to Lane’s husband and family, Lane was active outdoors and familiar with the area.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Further alarm was raised when Lane’s car was discovered further along the same stretch of road, with the rear window smashed.
