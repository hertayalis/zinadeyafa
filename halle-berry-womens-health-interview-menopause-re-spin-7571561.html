I have zero&nbsp;blanks&nbsp;to give anymore. I'm solidly in my womanhood. I finally realize what I have to say is valuable, even if no one else agrees.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to say that being frank and honest about "taboo" issues will make them less scary and offer up chances for women to speak about things that should be out in the open.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We can make talking about women’s health issues less taboo by daring to talk about it,” she added. “If you start the conversation, most women will follow. Do you know why? Because it's something that we're dying to do. It's something that we've been deprived of, and it's something that we want to share with one another. We just need the permission to do it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That sharing was why she started&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Re-Spin</a>, a digital health and wellness community that debuted&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>in 2020.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Community is the entrée into understanding.

She's ready to be "challenging all those stereotypes about how you have to look a certain way or feel a certain way," explaining that she's "smack-dab in the middle of menopause."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am challenging everything I thought I knew about menopause. Things like: ‘Your life is over.’ ‘You are disposable.’ ‘Society no longer has a place for you.’ ‘You should retire.’ ‘You should pack it up,’" she said. "The most important thing about owning your sexuality as a woman is accepting the station you're at — and embracing that. Own wherever you are. That's where I'm at."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qjpZ1dl7KzvthmrqillaPAbrTEmqOtoF2eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9dorKvu8%2BarKydXaeybr%2FPoqVmb2VsfnaCkA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
