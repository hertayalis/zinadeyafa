When the parapsychology department closed at Duke University, Rhine founded the Foundation for the Research into the Nature of Man in Durham, which was later called the Rhine Research Center, according to <a href=#>The Rhine.</a></p><p>The research center is still very much active today and carries with it a profound mission statement (via<a href=#>&nbsp;The Rhine</a>): "The Rhine's mission is to advance the science of parapsychology, to provide education and resources for the public, and to foster a community for individuals with a personal and professional interest in PSI."&nbsp;Through his work, J.B. Rhine opened the door of science to an entirely new world waiting to be discovered. With a brilliant mind and an openness to new perceptions, Rhine allowed those with their own experiences or curiosity to finally come together to find answers to questions that many before them were too afraid to ask.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEknBpa25fqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZquhnV2brrW0xKtkqJ5dorylsdGnZJ2ZqWK9or7Aqaqym5ikubCz2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
