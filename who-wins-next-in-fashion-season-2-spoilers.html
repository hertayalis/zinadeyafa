Throughout the season, we’ve seen Nigel’s talent over and over again, particularly in the way he deftly manipulates textiles and creates his own patchwork designs.</p><p class=tagStyle_4o6kkn-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_1pinbx1-o_O-style_48hmcm data-mm-id=_4ts759uos>His work is versatile and cutting-edge, it’s easy to see why he ultimately won the second season, although all three of the finalists were incredibly talented.
