Well, apparently everything.</p><p>The former Real Housewives of Orange County star is accusing <strong><a href=#>Dr. Terry Dubrow</a></strong> of cheating on <strong><a href=#>Heather Dubrow</a></strong>, but Heather is not here for it.</p><p><a href=#>@bravohousewives</a> posted a photo that read “Kelly Dodd alleged that Terry Dubrow was cheating on Heather Dubrow with his office assistant” on Instagram, as well as Heather’s response to the rumor.</p><p>“Heather Dubrow is setting the record straight. The Real Housewives of Orange County star has been married to Dr. Terry Dubrow for 23 years and counting. And while marriage has its ups and downs, one thing Heather won’t tolerate is cheating,” the account captioned the photo. “So Heather is now hitting back after Kelly Dodd claimed that Terry was cheating on social media.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>They wrote:</p><p>As reported by Reality Blurb, the debacle started when they shared a photo of Heather and castmate Shannon Beador on their Instagram account. The caption teased a moment at the reunion between the two where Heather revealed that she knew about David Beador cheating on Shannon for years. Kelly jumped in the comments with an accusation about Terry. Kelly’s comment read, “Don’t throw stones at glass houses HD! EVERYONE IN NEWPORT BEACH KNOWS TERRY WAS BANGING HIS OFFICE ASSISTANT!! (Allegedly). Don’t want to get sued a 3rd time!! It’s common knowledge here ask anyone! HYPOCRITE.”</p><p>But for Heather’s part, she won’t entertain the rumors.</p><p>“Heather took to her podcast, Heather Dubrow’s World, to refute the claims,” the caption continued. “She stated, ‘There’s a rumor online right now that Terry was like banging his assistant for years. It’s not true. I’m not going to give it any weight or any life because it’s stupid. But, the point is this: For me, cheating is like the one, it was my one hard no.’”</p><p>Heather has been the center of a lot of drama lately, including an ongoing feud with her co-star, <strong><a href=#>Noella Bergener</a></strong>.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>According to a post by <a href=#>@therealhousewiveszone</a>, Heather addressed a lie that was told by Noella amid their ongoing feud.</p><p>“‘Here’s the lie that was told at the reunion that did not make it to the air,’ Heather began on her latest episode of Heather Dubrow’s World&nbsp;@realityblurb&nbsp;reports. The drama started when the two had a conversation at Heather’s home,” the caption read from the account’s post on May 1.</p><p>They wrote:</p><p>“She came in and I said, ‘Can I get you anything? Water? Champagne?’ ‘No no no, thank you.’ They were setting up the cameras at my studio. We’re waiting right outside the studio door to come in and I said again, I go, ‘Are you sure I can’t get you anything?’ Because she loves champagne. She goes, ‘No I drove.’ And I said, ‘But you say you never drive. Why did you drive?’ And she said, ‘I don’t know. But my car was canceled,’” Heather alleged, noting that Noella was referring to the car given to her by production.</p><p>“They always offer us a car, especially if there might be alcohol…&nbsp;even if we’re going to the nail salon. They’ll say, ‘Are you going to be drinking?’” Heather explained. She claims after Noella left her home, she learned the show newbie had spread some major misinformation about her.</p><p>“[Noella] told almost every cast member afterward that I, Heather, I had her car canceled and tried to pump her full of champagne so that she would get a DUI. I mean, are you out of your mind?” Heather asked of Noella. “I would never do that.. Do you really think I am so psychotic that I would want you to hurt or kill yourself or others? It’s just so crazy and she told more than one cast member.”</p><p>Now, trapping someone into getting a DUI is serious, and seriously not like something Heather would do (especially with cameras around).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmoZ2RqbWmvoydrJuqn6x6pLTEmquippdiv7a5zquqZm1da3pzfo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
