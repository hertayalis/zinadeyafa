A few days after weathering a controversial interview, Thorne was on Instagram showing off a new designer outfit and giving those bedroom eyes the kind of workout her admirers beg for.</p><p>Bella Thorne posted the images to her official Instagram page in a black and white print ensemble from Chanel. She wears a halter top, skirt, an adorable headband, and makes them all look like they were made just for her. She praises the designers in her caption, writing, ‚Äúfeelin 11 out of 10 in&nbsp;<a href=#>@chanelofficial</a>&nbsp;üñ§üñ§‚Äù You can feast your eyes on those images below.</p><p>Apparently, Bella Thorne is no worse for wear after an unpleasant confrontation with <a href=#>Bill Maher</a> earlier this week on his podcast Club Random. As reported by <a href=#>Yahoo</a>, after Thorne opened up about her anxiety issues, including using marijuana to help with the symptoms, Maher asked her why people in her age group seemed to suffer so much from anxiety. When she answered that to her and others like her, there seemed to be ‚Äúconstant bad, bad, bad everywhere you look.‚Äù Maher called this a ‚Äúdisingenuous argument‚Äù (which is strange because it wasn‚Äôt an argument, it was the answer to a question, but okay), and then proceeded to insult Thorne and people in her age group, calling them ignorant and saying, ‚ÄúSo how can you be that f‚Äîing concerned about what‚Äôs going on in the world? I know what‚Äôs going on in the world! I should have the anxiety! I follow it, you kids don‚Äôt follow it. You don‚Äôt know what the f‚Äìk is going on in the world! What are you upset about?‚Äù</p><p>As recounted by <a href=#>The Independent</a>, Bella Thorne fans took Maher to task for the interview on Twitter, calling the host insensitive and monstrous. Among other things, fans were furious at the comedian‚Äôs comments forcing Thorne to talk about a childhood tragedy as well as abuse she suffered at a young age. One of the most appropriate quotes, however, wasn‚Äôt necessarily about Maher‚Äôs cruelty toward Thorne, but his self-aggrandizing rant. Raw Story editor <a href=#>Bob Brigham</a> commented on a claim Maher made about himself, while at the same time making some sly commentary on the host‚Äôs talents. You can see that tweet below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Thorne starred in Measure of Revenge which released last month to less than stellar reviews. Her next big screen appearance will be in the action thriller Rumble Through the Dark, based on the 2020 Michael Farris Smith novel The Fighter. According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, Rumble will be set in the Mississippi Delta where cage fighter Jack Boucher, played by Aaron Eckhart (Thank You for Smoking), struggles to pay his debt to a mob boss. Bella Thorne will play the carnival hustler Annette. After that she‚Äôll appear in the long-brewing The Trainer which promises an ensemble cast including Steven Van Zandt (The Sopranos), <a href=#>Stephen Dorff</a> (Blade), Gina Gershon (Face/Off), Soo Joo Park (Sense8), and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkpq5ra2MrZ%2Boqp6aerG0zq2mrGWTna6vsctmoKerpJa0s63MZqqenKWYwarCxGefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
