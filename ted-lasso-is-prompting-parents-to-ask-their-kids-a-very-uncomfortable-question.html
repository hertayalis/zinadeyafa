In truth, the show has never shied away from nudity or making jokes about sexual content, but pegging is certainly a new one, and it’s turning the heads of older viewers who are not familiar with the concept. And what’s the first thing a parent does when they don’t know something? Ask their children for insight, naturally.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Despite Ted Lasso being targeted at an adult audience, that doesn’t make it any easier for some viewers to approach this subject with their family members. As one can imagine, this is generating a wave of joking complaints online, as folks grapple with the mortifying ordeal of having to explain what pegging is to their parents.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks to <a href=#>@TedLasso</a>, I got to explain pegging to my 75 year old mother this morning.
