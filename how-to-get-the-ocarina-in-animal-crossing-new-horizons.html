Ask him about what he’s selling, and he has a wide variety of options available to you. Closer to the middle of his available items, you will find a DIY recipe book. You can purchase it for 480 Bells, which is an excellent price for a full book of things you can do and start making on your island.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube"></figure><p data-injection=true>When you obtain the book head on over to a crafting table to look it up, it only takes five clay pieces to craft it, which is a quick process, but locating clay can be a little difficult. To find clay, grab a shovel or an axe and start hitting boulders on your island or on the ones you visit in Mysterious Tours. After you have all five pieces, return to the crafting table to make it.</p><p>There are plenty of things for you to make in&nbsp;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&nbsp;Make sure you stay on the lookout for materials to craft your favorite items, and you locate more DIY recipes to expand your growing collection of projects. There’s always something to do, and Tom Nook is always rewarding you, Nook Miles, for your hard work.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
