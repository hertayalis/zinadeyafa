The actors, who share two young daughters together, have an &#34;amazing support group&#34; in their mothers, sisters, and family members. Mendes said dealing with fame while raising kids is &#34;super scary,&#34; but she tries to keep their lives normal and out of the spotlight. Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling are extremely tight-lipped about their nearly eight-year relationship and two young daughters—Esmeralda, 4, and Amada, 2—but the actress opened up about their family life in her new cover story for Women's Health."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Ryan Gosling happened," were her exact words. "I mean, falling in love with him," she explained to the magazine. "Then it made sense for me to have … not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes and Gosling first kicked off dating speculation after they appeared in the 2011 film The Place Beyond the Pines together. Their only joint red carpet appearance was at the movie's premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. Mendes didn't accompany Gosling during the 2017 awards season when he and La La Land earned multiple nominations; however, she did watch his Golden Globes win (and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a19823/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-golden-globes-speech/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his sweet shoutout to her" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">his sweet shoutout to her</a>) from home while their kids were in the other room watching PBS.</p><p><h2 class="css-1w9kuwj e1bddzxd0">The Place Beyond The Pines</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Watch Movie for The Place Beyond The Pines" data-href=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECU2X9U/ data-product-url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECU2X9U/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECU2X9U/?tag=harpersbazaar_auto-append-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/UBMq/amazon-the-place-beyond-the-pines","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Movie" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECU2X9U/ data-vars-ga-product-id=e7f52f89-7856-4113-bc62-32f7621abf90 data-vars-ga-product-price=$3.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9a4bcdcb-e222-4e38-9944-22013cc89bc7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Movies data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=B00ECU2X9U data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Place Beyond The Pines" title="The Place Beyond The Pines" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1555442794-519OORJfx5L.jpg width=375 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Raising two children as Hollywood stars is no easy feat, but Gosling and Mendes have plenty of help from their family. "We have an amazing support group: Ryan’s mom, my mom, Ryan’s and my sisters. It’s a village that helped us," Mendes told Women's Health. "My heart goes out to women who do this alone. I basically come from a single-parent household; although I love my dad, my mom mostly raised four of us on her own."</p><img alt="Celebrity Sightings in New York City - September 30, 2017" title="Celebrity Sightings in New York City - September 30, 2017" width=2399 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-seen-at-tao-restaurant-for-snl-news-photo-856168254-1555443285.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Robert Kamau</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gosling and Mendes during a rare NYC outing in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There's also the "concern" of keeping her children out of the spotlight and away from paparazzi. (She and Gosling don't make many public appearances with their kids.) "Not only are we in the industry, but the whole fame component is super scary when you try to raise your kids," she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress keeps her daughters somewhat in the dark about her career to help keep their lives as normal as possible. Mendes doesn't let her girls see her "put attention" into her appearance and they haven't seen her at work, she told Women's Health. "I’m just Mom," she added. "And I’m more than happy to just be Mom."</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt="Dress, Fashion, Gown, Design, Pattern, Pattern, Outerwear, Sleeve, Wedding dress, Formal wear, " title="Dress, Fashion, Gown, Design, Pattern, Pattern, Outerwear, Sleeve, Wedding dress, Formal wear, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bazbride-link-clicktojoin-carine2-1555444954.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">.</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ: Ryan Gosling & Eva Mendes are Couple Goals" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/evamendes-10683756-1722094701337458-1069913939-n-1539611271.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
