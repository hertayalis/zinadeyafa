 Answer :
The vast majority of Hindus are lacto-vegetarians (that is, they do not eat meat or eggs), however others may consume lamb, chicken, or fish in moderation. Beef is always avoided because the cow is revered as a holy animal, while dairy products are consumed in large quantities.
 
People also inquire as to what faith forbids the consumption of lamb. According to your argument, everyone should be a vegetarian because most animals are prohibited by some religious doctrine and Buddhists refuse to consume any animals at all, according to your reasoning."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is true that, as atheists, we have a Moral Obligation to consume lamb because it is a religious animal.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Aside from the ones listed above, are there any religions that forbid the consumption of certain foods?</h3><p>&nbsp;Religion. Pork is not eaten by Muslims and Jews, for religious reasons. Their various types of meat must be slaughtered in a specific manner, and meat must be kept separate from other foods while it is being processed. A large number of Hindus do not consume cows, and many others do not eat meat from other animals.</p><p></p><h3>It’s also important to understand why you shouldn’t eat lamb.</h3><p>A few weeks after birth, lambs are routinely “tail docked,” which means their tails are cut off. Farmers assert that this is done in order to reduce the accumulation of faecal matter around the animals’ backsides. The procedure, however, is conducted without anaesthesia and frequently results in infection, chronic pain, and rectal prolapse as a result of the mutilation.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What religions forbid the consumption of shellfish?</h3><p>In Judaism, almost all non-piscine seafood such as shellfish, lobster, shrimp, and crayfish are prohibited since these animals live in water but do not have both fins and scales, as do all other types of seafood. As a general rule, all seafood is permitted under the three madh’habs of Sunni Islam, with the exception of seafood from the Hanafi school of thought.</p><p></p><h3>There were 38 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What foods are considered taboo in Christianity?</h3><p>In addition, Christians of the Seventh-day Adventist tradition “avoid eating meat and highly flavoured meals” in general, according to the tradition.

It is said that the Buddha permitted his monks to have pork, chicken, and fish since the Buddha and his monks went out to collect alms food and were unable to prepare meals for themselves. Consequently, whatever is offered</p><p></p><h3>What foods are off-limits to Muslims?</h3><p>Pork is the most commonly encountered example of haram (non-halal) cuisine (pig meat products). While pork is the only flesh that Muslims are prohibited from consuming (Sura 2:173 and 16:115 of the Quran forbid it), other meals that are not in a state of purity are also deemed haram.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the reason that pork is not kosher?</h3><p>Pigs are characterised as being prohibited in this section because they have a cloven hoof yet do not eat their cud, according to the text.

In today’s Hindu culture, however, the great majority of food gifts to deities are vegetarian in origin.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What religions forbid the consumption of pork?</h3><p>Hindus do not consume meat. They have a cult of the animals. Pork is not allowed in the Muslim diet. Vegetarianism is practised by the Buddhists, while severe veganism is practised by the Jains, who will not even eat root vegetables because of the harm it causes to plants.</p><p></p><h3>What foods do Jews abstain from eating?</h3><p>Kashrut (Jewish dietary regulations) Certain foods, most notably pig and shellfish, are prohibited; meat and dairy products may not be combined; and meat must be ritually slaughtered and salted to eradicate all traces of blood before being consumed. Observant Jews will only consume meat or poultry that has been certified as kosher by an outside organisation.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Did the Brahmins of ancient times consume meat?</h3><p>Brahmins, particularly south Indian Brahmins, and Banias are two communities that are categorically opposed to eating meat (merchant class). Over a period of time, they have converted to vegetarianism.</p><p></p><h3>When you eat lamb, you are consuming a protein that is high in fat. Is it a baby, or is it something else?</h3><p>Years-old mutton is the meat of a mature ram or ewe that has been slaughtered at least once; yearling mutton refers to the meat of a sheep that has been slaughtered between 12 and 20 months. Baby lamb is typically marketed as meat from sheep that are 6 to 10 weeks old, whereas spring lamb is typically offered as meat from lambs that are 5 to 6 months old.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Lamb is classified as a type of meat.</p><p>In general, a sheep in its first year is referred to as a lamb, and the meat from that sheep is also referred to as lamb. Hogget is the meat of a juvenile sheep that is more than one year old; outside of the United States, this is also the term used to refer to the living animal. Mutton is the meat of an adult sheep, which is a term that is exclusively used to refer to the meat and not the actual animals.</p><p></p><h3>Is it normal for humans to consume red meat?</h3><p>Red meat is the meat of mammals that is typically red in colour when it is uncooked.
