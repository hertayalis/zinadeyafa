Dean ordered a second round on the spot, since they were gone in less than 60 seconds.</p><p>We didn’t stop there! We ordered wings, ribs, salad, salmon, short ribs, shrimp + grits, and a handcrafted ice cream shake. We rolled out of there! The food and the ambiance made me one huge fan. We can’t wait to hit PROOF again for date night.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_6055-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christms + Homemade Hot Chocolate.

It is usually set on the great lawn overlooking the desert, with white lights strung all over the trees. However, the light rain dampened the outdoor experience so it was a necessity to move indoors. It was still magical! They transformed the ballroom into a Christmas wonderland with a large movie screen playing the funniest Christmas movie of all time, Elf.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0132-1-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christmas and Homemade Hot Chocolate.

My little Sadie couldn’t get to her plate fast enough! For a small fee, they offered homemade hot chocolate made with high quality chocolate and heavy cream. It was topped off with marshmallows, vanilla bean whipped cream, and real chocolate shavings. There was salted caramel corn cupcakes, a huge array of candy, and fresh cinnamon churros dipped in homemade caramel or hot fudge.

Their patios were private, secluded, and overlooked a large mountain. It was so peaceful and as we sat there, we looked at each other and said, “Is this real life?” There is something rejuvenating about getting away from the city and being in the solitude of nature.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0188-1-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christms + Homemade Hot Chocolate.

My husband was determined to climb the mountain straight outside our private patio. I made it about halfway up but my husband made it to the top and saw one incredible Arizona sunrise. For those who like to use a trail, the Four Seasons Troon North has a popular trail connected to their resort.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0263.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christms + Homemade Hot Chocolate.

There was a happy crowd of holiday dressed kids, all waiting and excited to get their hands on the sweet offerings. The activities took place in a large ballroom and the kids were entertained for hours.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0304-1-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christmas.

They each received a jar full of cookie dough and filled it with all of their favorite toppings from M & M’s to peppermint candy canes to white chocolate chips and everything else in between. Each jar had the child’s name on it and while they were busy doing other fun activities, the Elves baked their cookies.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0292-1-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christmas.

The large tables were lined with colored royal icing, sturdy gingerbread cookies, and sparkling sugar. Sadie didn’t want to leave the table! She spent over an hour decorating ten cookies!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0333-1-copy.jpg alt="Arizona Four Seasons Christmas.
