I’m not as intricately involved in it as other [projects],” he said, adding, “So I’m not sure what state we’re at right now.”</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>Constantine fans dared to hope for a sequel to the 2005 cult classic for years, then finally in Fall 2022 it was announced that a sequel was happening with Keanu Reeves reprising the lead role and director Francis Lawrence returning behind the camera. However, about a month later, the entire DC slate was thrown into chaos when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran</a> were announced as co-heads of the studio.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Originally, Reeves said there was a place for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Constantine 2 at the new DC</a>, but last month the actor seemed less sure. He said he was “hoping that there was” a place for the movie in DC’s new slate, but that he and the team behind the sequel just “don’t know” at this juncture. He noted simply, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yeah, we’re trying</a>.”</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Fans are still holding out hope since Reeves did say he’s had discussions with James Gunn about the film, but perhaps the fate of the movie has less to do with Gunn’s feelings and more to do with Gunn’s performance as co-head of the studio and writer/director of several of the new DC properties. If those prove to be a success, then presumably Gunn will have more freedom to greenlight whatever he wants.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Clearly, Reeves’ stock has never been higher, so we doubt his involvement is considered a drawback by Warner Bros. Discovery. Maybe they just want to see their new plan start paying off before greenlighting anything else. So have patience, Constantine fans. Hell wasn’t made in a day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8KopayskaPBqrrEZmlmqKKksbavxKuqZqSRmLhuu8Vmoqenp6GypbPEZpibp6WperW0xGadoqSdqHq0wMCtrKxlk5bAtb%2BMn6yrrJiav26wzq6ZrWWfo3qqwIyamq2tkaG5unnHmqepnZ6eu6h7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
