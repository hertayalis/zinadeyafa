He attended a performing arts high school in New York, so he perfected those skills, along with his acting chops, while he was a student. Timothée even developed a rap persona in his teenage years that will most definitely haunt him forever. Let's take a look at his past as a rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothée Chalamet was once a rapper known by Lil Timmy Tim.</h2><p>Before he made it big as a movie star, Timothée's passion was rapping. He attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York, which is where he developed his rap persona.</p><p>Timothée reflected on his rapping days — during which he went by the stage names Lil Timmy Tim and Timmy Tim — in an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Graham Norton Show</a> back in 2019. Throughout the interview, he looked uncomfortable and embarrassed, but that's what makes his fans love him even more!</p><p>The interview touched on Timothée's most famous song, the absolute bop "Statistics." While in school, Timothée wrote and performed a rap for his statistics class. He sang about how much he appreciated his teacher, Ms. Lawton, and how he'd be famous one day.</p><p>The catchy tune will stay in your head for days, and you won't even realize you're singing along until it's too late. Check out the hilariously cringe-worthy track below:</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: Timothée Chalamet</span></figure><p>Timothée has also taken his raps to the stage plenty of times, and thankfully, there is footage still online for our amusement. He often participated in Rising Star competitions and displayed the most chaotic energy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Timmy's annual performance was probably the best thing his classmates had ever seen, and we're jealous we weren't there to witness it in person. But we can watch it over and over on YouTube, thanks to the star's fandom posting it all over the platform. Here's Timothée's 2012 Rising Star performance, which is by far his best and funniest one.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: Timothée Chalamet</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothée Chalamet had a YouTube account called ModdedController360.</h2><p>For years, fans of the superstar claimed he had a secret YouTube account. The rumors are true, as Timothée recently confirmed that he is the owner of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ModdedController360</a> account on YouTube, where a pre-teen Timmy can be seen showing off his custom-painted Xbox 360 controllers.</p><p>How the fans found the channel, we don't know. But what we do know is that in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Hill</a>, Timothée confirmed the account was his.</p><p>"I actually had a YouTube channel that people found. It's youtube.com/moddedcontroller360. And I used to paint modded controllers. I did three, and I spray-painted them. I would like, open them up and paint them and I charged people $10."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter / @frostedchalamet</span></figure><p>We want to reiterate that Timothée Chalamet really is a man of many talents. He's successfully kicked off his main gig as an actor, and as a youth, he maintained side hustles like rapping and hand-painting custom Xbox controllers. Is there anything he can't do?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3MnqtmqpGlvaq6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
