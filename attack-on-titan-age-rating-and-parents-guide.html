This is what viewers can expect from watching the anime.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-much-blood-and-gore-is-in-attack-on-titan data-injectable=false>How much blood and gore is in&nbsp;Attack on Titan?</h2><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>This question has a simple answer: a lot.&nbsp;Attack on Titan&nbsp;follows <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the story of three kids</a> after their village gets attacked by Titans, who are basically naked giants that eat humans. Death scenes are incredibly gory and frequent throughout the series. The Titans often bite off limbs or heads in graphic scenes that depict tearing muscles, cracking bones, and glimpses of internal organs. It’s not a show for young children, or for those with weak stomachs, for that matter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><h2 id=h-is-there-sex-and-nudity-in-attack-on-titan data-injectable=false>Is there sex and nudity in&nbsp;Attack on Titan?</h2><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>There are no sex scenes in&nbsp;Attack on Titan,&nbsp;but there are a handful of references to sex — including prostitution and sex trafficking — throughout the series. While the Titans are all nude, they don’t have genitalia or nipples. There are a couple of characters depicted nude from behind, but there is no frontal nudity in the series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-does-attack-on-titan-contain-profanity data-injectable=false>Does&nbsp;Attack on Titan&nbsp;contain profanity?</h2><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>There is mild profanity. Most of the language is rated PG-13, with several instances where characters use the f word in the Japanese version. While the English dub doesn’t contain the F-bomb, it does have some less-extreme profanity, including “sh*t,” “son of a b*tch,” and “*sshole.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true></figure><h2 id=h-is-attack-on-titan-scary data-injectable=false>Is&nbsp;Attack on Titan&nbsp;scary?</h2><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Yes,&nbsp;Attack on Titan&nbsp;can be frightening for some. There aren’t any jump scares, but there are many intense scenes that may cause nightmares. Even if your child can look past the blood and gore, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Titans themselves are nightmare fuel</a>, as some of them are incredibly creepy-looking. The storyline is also sometimes disturbing as beloved characters, usually teenagers, frequently get killed off, which may also upset some viewers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>Ultimately, it’s up to you as a parent to determine whether or not your child can handle&nbsp;Attack on Titan.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6aq62Zk6B6sLqMraCtmZ5irqixjKuYraGenHqiusNmp5qqlaPBtHnGrqCdnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
