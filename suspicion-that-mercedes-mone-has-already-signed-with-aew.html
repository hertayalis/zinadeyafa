At this point, anything seems to be on the table, because both Tony Khan and the former Sasha Banks are known for surprises.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that he received word that WWE were no longer talking with Mercedes Mone. AEW had a plan to bring her in last year, but then in December, that working plan was reportedly not happening. Things can change in pro wrestling, and that is exactly what happened with Mercedes Mone.</p><p>Mercedes Mone and WWE started talking again, but then things hit a snag.<a href=#> It was then said that, “by December 29th, they fell apart</a>.” It was not noted exactly why they fell apart, as one side thought a price was too high while the other felt low-balled.</p><p>That being said, it is a very strong expectation that Mercedes Mone will end up in AEW. Sean Sapp went on to say with a fair amount of certainty that he believes that she may have already signed with Tony Khan.</p><p>“There were some talks and discussions online that Mercedes was in mind for a Giulia match in January, like right around this time of year, but I was told by NJPW sources that this has not been a possibility in like six months.”</p><p>“Now we had reported that Mercedes had been in talks with AEW and she is expected to join the company. Now, I’m going to have to probably explain what expected means to people who speak the English language an awful lot in the next couple of months, but she is expected to join the company.”</p><p>“I haven’t seen a contract. I haven’t had anyone from the company or Mercedes tell me that she signed a contract. That doesn’t mean I can’t suspect it. That doesn’t mean I can’t take context clues and apply it. That doesn’t mean I can’t follow leads on the situation.”</p><p>“She is expected to join AEW. From a personal perspective, me, right now on January 8th, I would be shocked if she did not join All Elite Wrestling. Based on the information that I have, that’s what is happening.”</p><p>Sean Sapp went on to say that, “with Mercedes, there is an expectation that she will be All Elite, and for me there is a suspicion that she already is.”</p><p>It was noted that Mercedes Mone is very good at hiding things, and she’s done it several times in the past. Only time will tell what happens with this situation, but AEW is returning to Jacksonville for their Homecoming at Daily’d Place, and Tony Khan likes to make those events special.</p><p>What’s your take on Mercedes Mone’s next move in pro wrestling?
