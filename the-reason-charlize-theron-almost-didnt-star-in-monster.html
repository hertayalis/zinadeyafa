"I also thought it was interesting because I don't think it's really a common thing for writers to write conflicted female characters."</p><p>The actress also said that she read that Wuornos never removed her shirt, even when prostituting herself, and that was part of why she put on weight for the part — to embody the murderer's insecurity and "scars" about her own body.</p><p>Theron isn't the only star who went to great lengths for a role. <a href=#>These stars also went to extremes for their art</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9hZ39xe9OhnGaqlZbAsLqMnJ%2Baqpyex6Z506Gcq6eeYq6tuc6sq2acmZm7tXnSrZirZZmjeq67zayrnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
