If you need help remembering who Lindsay is, she was the young girl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was babysitting when Michael Myers came to kill her. The low-budget film took the world by storm and became one of the biggest horror movies of all time, cementing Richards’ place in the movie’s history. This eventually led to Richards’ reprisal of the adult version of Lindsay Wallace forty-one years later in the 2021 sequel to the film, Halloween Kills, and will continue with Halloween Ends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>When she isn’t dodging homicidal murderers, Richards is busy putting out fires (and sometimes starting them) in her hit reality show, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, a favorite outlet used by the stars on the show, Richards makes $500,000 per season. Along with her sometimes-controversial role on the show, she is also known for her businesses, namely luxury clothing line, Kyle by Alene Too, which closed its doors in 2018, and current clothing line Kyle x Shahida.
