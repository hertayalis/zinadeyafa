Sadly, Amanda lost her mother to ovarian cancer seven years ago but is very close to her dad, Armando.</p><p id=efxCIF1OnVe data-wc=61>Wilmer admitted it is great to be surrounded by his daughter's grandparents as he is never short on babysitters when he and Amanda want to enjoy a date night. "As soon as the baby goes down, we hop on our Vespa and just cruise around the neighborhood. You find new ways to do date night," he told Parents Latina in 2022.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><p id=elgnsQVco1X data-wc=38>Wilmer purchased his home – which once belonged to Chuck Norris – in his mid-20s. It had six bedrooms and nine bathrooms before he bought the property next door in 2019 to give his family even more space.</p><p id=eaABgKAN2mD data-wc=45>Back in 2020, he shared a glimpse inside the compound in Architectural Digest, revealing an incredible memorabilia-turned-glam room that has been covered from floor-to-ceiling in vintage newspapers. It is also home to a classic barber chair where his stylist, Christine Nelli, cuts his hair weekly.</p><p id=eB-hiBcJcwR data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS: What are Mark Harmon, Pauley Perrette and more's net worths?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eMJ8V86-Yf- data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS star candidly admits: I feel different from my costars</a></strong></p><p id=e5GrRIsudhf data-wc=18>"It's so incredible to have a time capsule on these walls," he said of the room's unique décor.</p><p id=e-VQDaElu1x data-wc=30>"There are headlines like, 'Holyfield bites the ear,' the assassination of John Lennon and From Dusk Till Dawn, which meant something to me because I was in the series later."</p><p id=ej0jc6Gpcf- data-wc=33>Wilmer's home is filled with vintage and modern touches including an antique wooden bar in his living room, a coffee table made from a retired Japanese fishing boat propeller, and modern light fixings.</p><p id=e9u7aJZKfP8 data-wc=38>"Everything you see on the walls and the furniture was not done because some amazing interior designer decided this is the way it looks," he said. "Everything was hand-picked because it made me feel some type of way."</p><p id=eq3TkSOI8Z data-wc=56>Meanwhile, more recently, Wilmer paid a heartfelt tribute to his wife-to-be on his Instagram to mark her birthday. The actor shared a series of images of Amanda looking stunning in a room surrounded by blue lanterns, as he penned in the caption: "As I searched for a photo to honor your birthday, I came across these.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWsYCYS_yZ data-wc=39>"In a way these were the ones that got somewhat close to what the world turns into when you walk in a room.… thank you for sharing your heart with Nakano and me.
