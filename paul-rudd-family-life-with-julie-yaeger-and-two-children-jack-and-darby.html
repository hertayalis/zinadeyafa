"When I think about myself, I think of myself as a husband and a father, like I'm that," he said to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in 2021. "I just hang out with my family when I'm not working.

After making a name for himself in the cult classic, Clueless, the actor moved to New York, and followed the advice of director Amy Heckerling to get a publicist.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ffe26b8ad946-paul-rudd-with-wife-julie-2003.jpg><p id=eg8iajZLE92 data-wc=40>When he arrived at the publicist's office with his luggage, he was quickly introduced to Julie, who was working there at the time. "She was the first person I met in New York," Paul revealed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Marie Claire</a> in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p id=eE80QINRv_b data-wc=61>"We started talking and there was a maturity with her – she had experienced some tragedy in her life, I had too, and the impression I got was, wow, this is a woman. This isn't a girl.

Today, she works as a producer and screenwriter.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLd65vuS3cr data-wc=54>By 2004, Paul and Julie had welcomed their son Jack into the world, and as of 2009, they are also proud parents to a daughter named Darby. The family appears to reside in Rhinebeck, New York, close to the candy shop that Paul co-owns with his close friend and fellow actor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/42c0c0bf5213-paul-rudd-with-family.jpg><p id=eKYZ1HYGctv data-wc=16>Speaking about his role as a father, in 2018, Paul admitted that he's an "embarrassing dad."</p><p id=eWJx2f-SnMa data-wc=42>"Oh, I'm still the embarrassing dad," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Marie Claire</a>. "My daughter is eight and thinks I'm the bee's knees. My son is 13 and doesn't even want me going to his school. I make jokes to a series of eye rolls."&nbsp;</p><p id=e9EtydxvDxv data-wc=88>It wasn't until Paul's son Jack turned 15 that he was able to fully grasp what his dad does for a living. Recalling an adorable story to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>NME</a>, Paul explained that when Jack was five, "He went to a movie theatre with his friends, and there was a poster that I was on, in the lobby. They all just assumed I worked at the movie theatre, which I felt was very cute. I never corrected him. When he was 15, I think he finally put it all together."</p><p id=esafIyFdpd data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Meryl Streep's 45-year marriage to husband Don Gummer</a></p><p id=ehviZ7W7dyG data-wc=19><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: inside Selena Gomez's sweet friendship with 'best friends' Steve Martin and Martin Short</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d0188d5ec39-paul-rudd-son-z.jpg><p id=e9cemhnI5Nt data-wc=23>As for his daughter, Darby has watched a number of Paul's films, and he's even left some easter eggs in them for her.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9GxDLWhiZ8 data-wc=73>"At first when [my daughter] was very young, I used to think, is it going to be weird when my daughter is old enough and she sees this movie?
