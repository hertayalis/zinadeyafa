The incident dates back to 2015 at the time of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>WrestleMania</a> 31. Shockingly enough, the threat came from Hulk’s former wrestling ally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As per <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>TMZ</a>’s report, Scott Steiner gave the death threat of the WWE Hall of Famer to his wife. The menacing event scared Jennifer in San Jose, where she was all alone.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>A threat by former WWE wrestler to kill Hulk Hogan</b></h2><p><span>Once Hogan got the news, he joined his wife to file a police complaint against the 60-year-old wrestler. Jennifer explained the incident that Scott came over and grabbed her at the baggage claim. He then said that he plans to “</span><i><span>kill Terry</span></i><span>” [Hulk’s real name] as soon as he lands.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/0_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>After a good investigation into the matter, police found the airport surveillance video.

However, Steiner was quite vocal about his dislike for The Hulkster for years now. He even used to blame him for the downfall and eventual demise of WCW wrestling, where the two were allies.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Hulk-Hogan-nwo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>Even after the disclosure of this entire episode, TMZ asked Steiner about his thought on it.
