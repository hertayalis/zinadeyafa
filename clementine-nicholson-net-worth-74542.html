On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 23 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.</p><span>2014</span><p>On August 27, 2014, Lakeshore Entertainment announced their plans to develop a reboot of the <i>Underworld</i> franchise, with Cory Goodman hired to write the script for the first film.
