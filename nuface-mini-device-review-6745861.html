This type of technology delivers electrical currents to the skin and underlying muscle to increase cellular activity and create tighter, more lifted appearances. And, while it's typically used in-office by estheticians and dermatologists, there are a handful of at-home devices that can deliver instant results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">NuFACE is one of those brands. It originally launched with the Facial Toning Device, which celebrities such as Bella Hadid <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>swear by</a>. Then, they released the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Line Smoothing Device</a>, which is great for lifting more delicate and hard to reach areas, such as under the eyebrows and the outer corners of the eyes. After that, they launched the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>NuBODY device</a>, which uses the same technology on a larger panel to lift and tone areas such as the thighs and glutes. And now? NuFACE just came out with its smallest device yet — but don't let the size fool you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The NuFACE Mini+ is&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a customizable version</a>&nbsp;of the OG Facial Toning Device that custom-tailors treatments to your face's needs — all packed in a fun-sized tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Technically you could use it on its own, but you can get next-level results by downloading the NuFACE app to your smart phone to discover and unlock the brand's innovative 3-Depth technology (more on that in a minute). Once you download it and create your login, you can discover different "skin workouts" that help tighten, lift, and tone your face. It's intuitive, easy, and helps you to step up your skincare game.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each workout has a different target. For example, the skin-tightening mode works to blur fine lines and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Instant-lify tones and contours the face, and he pro-toning is designed to create long-term, deep facial toning — essentially the marathon goal of microcurrent treatments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As if that weren't enough, you can also take selfies to record your skin's "progress" with every treatment you do. And if you're forgetful as I sometimes am, then you'll love that you can set up treatment reminders to stay on track.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of NuFACE</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$245; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mynuface.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using the app with the Mini+ has become a regular part of my skincare routine. And don't get me wrong, I still love my original Facial Toning Device, but I love that the app opens up options that I hadn't thought of before. In the same way that I love guided meditations, I love guided skin treatments. I'm particularly fond of "the neck lift" workout and the "cheek pop" for when I'm trying to give myself a sharper jawline and popping cheekbones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, the Mini+ is water-resistant. Not that I'm doing a microcurrent treatment in the bathtub or anything, but as someone who is clumsier than most, I no longer have to worry about accidentally dropping it into the sink and ruining it forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Splurge</a>&nbsp;is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are worth it.
