Under his direction, research was conducted in the 1980s that demonstrated how numerous treatment strategies, for example, can be chosen depending on the type of presenting problem."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He salvaged the field from a failing behavior modification course by choosing treatment based on the behavior rather than the desired outcome.</p><p>We can predict the effects of both reinforcement and extinction, as Brian is well aware, and extinction may succeed even when the negative behavior is rewarded.</p><p>He invented the practice of naming reinforcements. I asked him a question on automatic reinforcement at one of his well-regarded presentations on functional assessments.</p><p>He wisely declined to examine a topic for which there was insufficient evidence. Brian is aware that his concerns will be resolved in the end. His comment prompted me to argue for the investigation of automatic functions and language contingencies as a means of explaining language—an area of behavior effect that behavior analysis typically overlooks.</p><p>It is tough and heartbreaking for me to move the above from the present to the past tense because he died at the age of 75. Brian was a wonderful friend and mentor. I hope that the inevitable ups and downs of life do not bother his wife Peg, their daughters Christine and Mary Ann, and their families.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
