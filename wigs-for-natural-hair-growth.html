You'll want to consider your budget, personal preference, and whether you're new to wigs or not when determining which wig is best for you. While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>synthetic wigs</a> are more affordable and require less maintenance than human hair wigs, they're also less versatile when it comes to styling and can look less realistic. "Full human hair wigs are my preference for wigs used for protective styling," says Everett. "It will allow all of your hair to be protected, rather than [having leave-out] to be styled and blended in with the wig."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter which type of wig you decide on, make sure to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protect it from heat styling</a>. "When using a U-part wig or half wig, roller set your leave-out and smooth down your edges," Everett suggests. "I use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Sebastian Mousse Forte</a> for any of my roller sets, twist sets, or smoothing sets. It has a heat protectant and helps to blend your natural hair and wig together."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prep-natural-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prep Natural Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wearing a wig doesn't mean that you can disregard your natural hair underneath. You will still need to take care of it otherwise you run the risk of doing much more harm than good. Much like traditional protective styles, braids and twists are your best bet. And yes, in this instance, size does matter. "Smaller <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cornrows</a> allow the wig to lay flatter to the head," says Everett. Also, make sure they're done loosely to prevent any unnecessary tension, which can cause damage to both the hair and scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Traction alopecia</a> is caused by the hair being pulled too tightly," Everett tells us. "Sometimes people will braid the hairline too tight and it will cause the area to become sore. Some people develop little white bumps or a swollen scalp. These are sure signs that your braids are too tight and need to be redone with less tension. Adding a wig on top of the sore and irritated scalp can cause the hairline to become damaged and possibly break." Fortunately, preventing traction alopecia is easy: braid more gently, says Everett. "Braiding and cornrowing do not have to be painful. Remember that it is an old wives tale that braiding hair tighter allows the style to last longer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, don't get it twisted. Just because your hair won't be out in the world, doesn't mean you can skip wash day. It's still a vital part of your routine, even if your natural strands are covered. "To keep your hair clean, healthy, and moisturized, shampoo your natural hair no less than every seven to 10 days," Everett advises, adding that the hair should be completely dry before placing on your wig. Otherwise, you could end up with mildew growth — and that mildew smell — on both the hair and scalp. So yeah, yikes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Simone Biles Has the One Quarantine Hairstyle We All Wish We Had</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wig-styling-and-maintenance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wig Styling and Maintenance</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of whether you use a human hair wig or a synthetic hair wig, you should still make it a habit to wash both after every few uses. Human hair wigs will also benefit from using a conditioner. And while you can apply hot tools to human hair, heat styling is not recommended for synthetic wigs since it can damage (read: melt) the artificial fibers. Properly taking care of your wig will not only ensure it looks good, but it will improve its longevity too. So when you're not using your wig, consider storing it on a wig head or in a silk or satin bag.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is All Natural.
