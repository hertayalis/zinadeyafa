Myers’ case underscores the importance for content creators to remain vigilant about the legal implications of their content, especially when it involves regulated items such as firearms and explosives. The FPSRussia saga serves as a reminder that online fame can come with real-world consequences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qq3MoKalnKCWu6WtjZympmenncZusMidZJ%2Boo6fCtL%2FImmSgp12pvG62wKKjaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
