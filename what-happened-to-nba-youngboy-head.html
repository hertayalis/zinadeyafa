There's nothing in the reports that indicates that he did anything wrong. They arrested several people and there was no indication that he had any guns or drugs on him at the time of the arrest. I ultimately believe he will be found innocent in all of this," James Manasseh, <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBA YoungBoy's lawyer stated</a>, per a local news outlet.

NBA Youngboy needed a halo implanted after he broke his neck while wrestling when he was a four-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>NBA <a href=# rel=nofollow>Youngboy says he was lucky</a> and that he was immediately rushed to the hospital so that doctors could save his life.

"You know why I deleted my pictures off my page? [...] Women trying to incriminate me. Posting stupid shit. Well, they say stupid shit. I guess the people that they down talk a n--ga with leaked the shit. I don't know. That shit be playing mind games.
