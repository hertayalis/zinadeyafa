Lukas later appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maloney’s podcast</a>, “You’re Gonna Love Me with Katie Maloney.”</p><p>Gage revealed that he is a huge “Vanderpump Rules” fan. Since then, they’ve both posted the same picture lying in bed together, but have not confirmed they are dating. However, some fans took the snaps as an indication the two were Instagram official.</p><p>In Kirsten Doute’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> Sex, Love and What Else Matters, Katie appeared as a guest. The description for the episode, which came out on February 8, 2023, revealed that the Vanderpump Rules star is “single.”</p><p><strong>GRV Media and Reality Titbit have contacted Lukas and Katie’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vanderpump-rules-fans-think-lukas-is-katie-s-new-boyfriend>Vanderpump Rules fans think Lukas is Katie’s new boyfriend</h2><p>When Vanderpump Rules fans discovered Katie and Lukas’ pictures together, they congratulated Katie for moving on from her divorce in 2022. However, some just can’t see her in a relationship with someone other than her ex.</p><p>One wrote: “Happy New Year Katie: you look beautiful, and I am so happy for you.”</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gushed</a> on Reddit: “Are they together? I hope so.”</p><p>“I listened to a random podcast of hers this year and he was on it.

Thus far, he hasn’t been around for most of my happenings.”</p><p>She said in a confessional: “I’ve made out with, like, three people and then done the full deed with, like, two.
