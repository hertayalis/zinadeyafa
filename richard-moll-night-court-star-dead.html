His height may have felt like a detriment to a long-term acting career at first, as he started out with one- to two-episode appearances on shows like "Happy Days," "The Rockford Files," and "Laverne & Shirley." However, his casting on "Night Court" was the boost he needed to break free of being stuck solely as a character actor.</p><p dir=ltr>Moll certainly had the looks and demeanor to make a lasting impression on the hit sitcom. In addition to his astounding height and shaved head, the character of Bull on "Night Court" was also known for his catchphrase, "Ohh-kay."</p><p dir=ltr>Ironically, photos illustrate that outside of his "Night Court" role, the actor actually had a lush head of hair. He told Arsenio that "trained professionals" shaved his hair weekly when he was shooting, but he enjoyed letting it grow out as well. "I like all different kinds of looks. I'm a character man. I like to play all different kinds of things," Moll said during an appearance on <a href=#>"The Arsenio Hall Show."</a></p><p dir=ltr>Along with <a href=#>John Larroquette</a> (who played prosecutor attorney Dan Fielding), Moll was one of the last surviving members of the main "Night Court" cast, as <a href=#>Harry Anderson</a> (who played Judge Harry T. Stone), <a href=#>Markie Post</a> (who played defense attorney Christine Sullivan) and <a href=#>Charles Robinson</a> (who played clerk of court Mac Robinson) all preceded Moll in death. Larroquette stars as his original character in the 2023 "Night Court" reboot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZ4JzgY6roJygkaexbrnOpaNmppmctbV5wqisq6xdqMGivoydnJqcXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
