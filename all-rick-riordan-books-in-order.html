Some of them are based in the Percy Jackson world (also known as the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles), where Greek Gods exist in the modern era, whereas others exist in stories from completely different genres. He even has a standalone YA sci-fi novel, so no matter what genre of book you prefer you’ll probably find something of his that you won’t be able to stop reading.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>If you love Rick Riordan’s style and want to plunge into his work, or if you’re just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brushing up on Percy Jackson</a> before the new series drops, then our list of all Rick Riordan books in order will help you out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-rick-riordan-books-in-order data-injectable=false>All Rick Riordan books in order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rick-Riordan.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Aside from the Camp Half-Blood Chronicles, Riordan also wrote a number of other series.
