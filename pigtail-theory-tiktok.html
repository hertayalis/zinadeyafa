Sadly, this one is also hair-related. A social experiment on <a href=#>TikTok</a> continues to yield some predictably yucky results when it comes to how men treat women they perceive to be younger. So grab a barf bag, and let's dive into the very gross <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pigtail theory on TikTok</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the pigtail theory on TikTok? We don't love it!</h2><p>In September 2021, TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aliveandwellandsexy</a>, aka Grace, posted a brief but effective TikTok about wearing pigtails to work. In it she's wearing a pink hat, black T-shirt, and the aforementioned braids. Grace looks like any person going to work in the service industry, usually comfortable. However, we soon realize all is not what it seems.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@aliveandwellandsexy (video still)</a></figure><p>"When you wear pigtails to work, and make double the amount of <a href=#>tips</a> than usual," Grace captioned over the video. The implication is that she was tipped more, presumably by male customers, because pigtails tend to make the wearer look much younger. If we expand upon that further, and God help us because we must, the conclusion one can draw is men treat very young women better. Sadly, her experienced was echoed by many using the hashtag "pigtailtheory. "</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sadly, the pigtail theory seems to hold water for the women who tried it.</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pigtail theory hashtag</a> has garnered nearly 20 million views, with no end in sight. Countless women have tried it, and most of them have found that it works. They vary in age and appearance, which gives this experiment even more credence. TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Hawkins</a> tested it out one evening when she forgot to turn on the open sign for half her shift, yet reported that she took home more than her usual tips.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@just_dandyyy href=#>@just_dandyyy</a><p>It does infact work <a title=pigtailtheory href=#>#pigtailtheory</a> <a title=servers href=#>#servers</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=worklife href=#>#worklife</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Michelle Hawkins" href=#>♬ original sound - Michelle Hawkins</a></figure><p>"These things did something," said Michelle while holding up one of her pigtails. She then scrolls through her tips which shows folks handing over 23 percent, 34 percent, and event 50 percent as a tip. Michelle then offers some inclusive advice: "Ladies and dudes with long hair, if you wanna wear your pigtails, wear the heck out of them."</p><p>In April 2023, TikTok user <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">zalaiyanefwani</a> did what she called the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pigtail theory: Black girl edition</a>" at her job where she serves golfers while they play. One man called her "beautiful" after commenting on her pink skirt. At one point she got a $7 tip on a cup of ice. Finally, a gentleman agreed to purchase the 3-for-1 beer deal if zalaiyanefwani agreed to go out on a date with him.</p><p>If we want to spin this in a positive light, and we have to or we'll run screaming into the night, these women are using the male gaze for financial benefit. They are using a horrifying kind of attraction to their advantage by making more money. They are successfully working a system they did not establish, and while it's not ideal, we do applaud it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbaowMCio2asmJq8s8WMraCkrJ%2Bg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
