MSI B450M Bazooka Plus The B450M Bazooka and B450M Bazooka Plus are a pair of microATX motherboards from MSI’s entry-level Arsenal Gaming range. Both models share the same PCIe configuration and layout with a single full-length PCIe 3.0 x16 slot and two PCIe 2.0 x1 slots. Both boards share the same pairing of onboard audio and network controllers with the Realtek ALC892 8-channel audio codec and Realtek 8111H Gigabit LAN controller both being featured."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both models share the same PCIe configuration and layout with a single full-length PCIe 3.0 x16 slot and two PCIe 2.0 x1 slots. Both boards share the same pairing of onboard audio and network controllers with the Realtek ALC892 8-channel audio codec and Realtek 8111H Gigabit LAN controller both being featured.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13091/MSI%20B450M%20Bazooka%20and%20B450M%20Bazooka%20Plus%20Motherboards_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>MSI B450M Bazooka (left) and MSI B450M Bazooka Plus (right) microATX motherboards</p><p>The visuals are dominated by a black PCB with an industrial looking grey pattern printed on, with the main aesthetic&nbsp;differences between the two boards coming in the way of the heatsinks; the B450M Bazooka Plus has a bigger power delivery heatsink and has a light metallic grey look. The B450M Bazooka has a more basic looking set of heatsinks. Both models look to have a 6-phase power delivery operating in a 4+2 configuration.</p><p>While the B450M Bazooka Plus looks to be the more premium of the two microATX offerings, it has support for DDR4-3333 whereas strangely the B450M Bazooka has the ability to handle faster memory out of the box, with DDR4-3466 supported. Both models have a total of four memory slots meaning up to a maximum of 64 GB of system memory can be installed.</p><p>The options on both boards for storage are identical with both boards having four SATA 6 Gbps ports and a single PCIe 3.0 x4/SATA M.2 slot which allows drives up to a size of M.2 22110 (22 x 110 mm). The B450M Bazooka has two right-angled SATA ports with having straight angled connectors, while the B450M Bazooka Plus features four right-angled connectors.</p><p>Another subtle difference is the B450M Bazooka Plus adds another USB 3.1 5 Gbps header giving the capability to add up to four ports, whereas the B450M Bazooka has a single USB 3.1 5 Gbps header. Both boards can support an additional four USB 2.0 ports thanks to a pairing of USB 2.0 headers. For users looking to add extra RGB LED lighting in addition to the LED lighting onboard, the B450M Bazooka has a single 5050 RGB header, while the B450M Bazooka Plus has two.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13091/MSI%20B450M%20Bazooka%20and%20B450M%20Bazooka%20Plus%20Motherboard%20Rear%20Panels_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>MSI B450M Bazooka (top) and MSI B450M Bazooka Plus (bottom) rear panels</p><p>On the rear panel, both boards have four USB 3.1 5 Gbps ports, two USB 2.0 ports, an HDMI 1.4 output, a DVI-D output, three 3.5mm audio jacks due to the Realtek ALC892 audio codec, a single LAN port controlled by the Realtek 8111H Gigabit networking chip and a PS/2 combo port. The B450M Bazooka Plus has the added benefits of a BIOS Flashback+ button.</p><p>Both boards aim to win users looking to build a smaller budget gaming system, but without sacrificing on memory capacity and PCIe 2.0 x1 support by going for a small form factor such as Mini-ITX. The B450M Bazooka has better memory support on paper, while the B450 Bazooka Plus has better-styled heatsinks and increased RGB capabilities through a pairing of 5050 RGB headers. No pricing is currently available for the B450M Bazooka Plus, but the regular B450M Bazooka is set to retail for <a href=#>$84.99</a> at launch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50fJhqZpqmkaHGu7XNoGSbbGVleqe70WaYppxdp8a7sc1mmGappZ6wrHnLqKakZZGpeqK4y2aroZ1dory1tMSrmaiZopnAcH2X</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
