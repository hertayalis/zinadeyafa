KIHEI — The Seabury Hall girls paddlers had one thing in mind on Saturday at Maui Interscholastic League regatta No. 5: join their mixed and boys classmates as champions.
The Spartans’ Keala Bouwens, Kahea Haupu, Annalise Lambert, Kekua Richards, Amber Proctor and Tatum Hoshino edged rival King Kekaulike by a little more than a second to claim the girls MIL title at Ka Lae Pohaku."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The girls crew came up 3.45 seconds short of Na Alii last week.</p><p><span class=quotations>“What a race and we had so much errors to correct,”</span> Luuwai said. “The video tells a thousand words, so we’re, like, ‘Are you kidding?’ We totally fell on our heads last week and our top stroker was out — she had a throat infection. … She came back, Keala Bouwens has missed the last two (regattas) and she is a key in our boat.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The girls persevered, Kekaulike is a great team –five of those girls are my summer girls (for Hawaiian Canoe Club), so my hats off to them.
