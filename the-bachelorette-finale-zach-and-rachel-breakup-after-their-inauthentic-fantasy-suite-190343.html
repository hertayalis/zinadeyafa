On Tuesday night's episode of The Bachelorette, Zach and Rachel broke up following a heated conversation over their less-than-ideal Fantasy Suite.
The show's Sept. 6 episode ended on a cliffhanger, when Zach interrupted the rose ceremony to speak to Rachel, a conversation fans finally got to see play out in part 1 of the season finale.
The downward turn of Zach and Rachel's relationship was a surprise to fans, as the pair had a near-perfect Hometown date that made the pilot feel like she could &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Nothing coming out of tonight can change that."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Something did change that, though, as the cameras caught&nbsp;an awkward morning-after between the couple.&nbsp;In a confessional, Zach revealed more about the night, sharing that Rachel had asked if he was ready for marriage at age 25, which is several months younger than her 26.</span></p><p><span>"It’s like we were two strangers. I don’t know what it could be, but Rachel’s concern came out of nowhere," Zach said. "I think it’s bulls**t, to be honest. She was putting on a front. That scares me. That scares me a lot."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a conversation with host </span><a href=# rel>Jesse Palmer</a><span>, Zach noted that he was "blindsided" by Rachel's age concern, stating, "I&nbsp;thought I saw this future with her, and just to be completely gut punched and not feeling it at all... It’s shocking."</span></p><p><span>Then, in a confessional ahead of the rose ceremony, Zach said his Fantasy Suite talk with Rachel was "the most inauthentic conversation I’ve ever had."</span></p><p><span>"I was more than ready to get on one knee. The Rachel that I was falling in love with, I trusted her enough at least to show me her real self and I don’t think I got that. And I still don’t know why or how," he said. "What was that Rachel I was getting? That’s the biggest concern to me."</span></p><p><span>With that in mind, Zach pulled Rachel at the rose ceremony before she could hand out the roses.</span></p><p><span>"That Fantasy Suite felt a little off," Zach told Rachel during the most recent episode. "... Since day one I've always been honest with you... I thought what I was seeing wasn't the real Rachel, what I was seeing was Bachelorette Rachel."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Zach added that he's given his "absolute love" to Rachel, and said that feels "upset and disappointed that I wasn't able to get that from you."</span></p><p><span>"You were picking up on a little bit of a different vibe," Rachel admitted, adding that she "did find" clarity as a result of their Fantasy Suite.</span></p><p><span>"I was trying to find that missing piece for me," she explained. "I did think if we spent the night talking I could find it."</span></p><p><span>"I did really love you. I saw a future with you," Zach said.&nbsp;"But I need to go."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Rachel accepted that, telling Zach, "I wish I could've gotten there."</span></p><p><span>As he was driven away, an emotional Zach stated, "It's over just like that. I could just see in her eyes that it really meant something different to her than it meant to me. I don't know what I missed... This still doesn't feel real, because she was, in my mind, the future Mrs. Shallcross."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He went on to describe Rachel's goodbye as "cold," lamenting, "I thought maybe I meant more, but I guess I didn't. One of the things I fell in love with was she made me feel special and cared for. I question if that was real."</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Rachel said the situation was "really sad," before telling her remaining men, Tino and Aven, what happened.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"For people who say they care about me to... question my character, it's obviously disappointing," Rachel said, before awarding the other two men roses.</span></p><p><span>During the live portion of the show, Rachel and Zach hugged before clearing the air.</span></p><p><span>"I just want to say that I do apologize for ever making you feel like I called you out for your character," Zach told her. "... I was really in shock and disbelief... and I am so sorry."</span></p><p><span>"I'm sorry too," Rachel said. "That was really hard for me to watch back... Those feelings that I had, they were real and I don't want you to ever feel like I was putting on an act."</span></p><p><span>Leading up to the rose ceremony, Zach said he "was sick to my stomach," before calling the post-Fantasy Suite week "the toughest."</span></p><p><span>"You meant so much to me. I care about you. I really do want all the happiness in the world for you," Rachel told him. "... I never want you to feel like I would put you through something like that if I didn't see it."</span></p><p><span>Zach admitted that the whole thing was "a tough pill to swallow," before taking fans back inside the Fantasy Suite to explain how the night went down.</span></p><p><span>"It was really one of those moments where... it just kind of felt immediately off," he said. "It kind of felt like we were two strangers in a way... Maybe you had already realized I wasn't going to be your future person... It started off very early in the Fantasy Suites and it felt like a tough conversation."</span></p><p><span>As for Rachel questioning Zach's readiness, she explained, "I was never accusing you of not being ready... I really just wanted to know if you were ready in general... I do know that it was awkward for both of us."</span></p><p><span>In the end, Zach said he doesn't "really have any regrets," adding that "everything happens for a reason."</span></p><p><span>"You are such an incredible guy," Rachel told her ex. "... I appreciate you and I really do appreciate this conversation, honestly."</span></p><p><span>"I want the best for you,&nbsp;always," he replied.</span></p><p><i><span>Part 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;</span></i><a data-sk=tooltip_parent data-stringify-link=https://abc.com/shows/the-bachelorette delay=150 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelorette</a><i><span>'s live season finale will air Tuesday, Sept. 20&nbsp;on ABC.
